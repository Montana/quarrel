# quarrel
Simple text based fighting game written in Python. Dustin vs Montana.
# Usage

Open your terminal, make sure you make quarrel executable, and of course you have Python installed. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Montana/quarrel.git
```

Once the repo has been cloned, you can now run quarrel via: 

```
chmod u+x quarrel.py 
python
python quarrel.py
```

You should then see something like this, it is randomized, so Dustin or myself may or may not win.
