# quarrel
Simple text based fighting game written in Python. Dustin vs Montana.
# Usage

First clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Montana/quarrel.git
```

Once the repo is cloned, make quarrel executable, and of course make sure you have Python installed
```
chmod u+x quarrel.py 
python
python quarrel.py
```

You should then see something like this, it is randomized, so Dustin or myself may or may not win
