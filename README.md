# quarrel
Simple text based fighting game written in Python. Dustin vs Montana.
# Usage

Open your terminal, make sure the file has executable access, and of course Python installed 

```
chmod u+x quarrel.py 
python
python quarrel.py
```

You should then see something like this, it is randomized, so Dustin or myself may or may not win.
